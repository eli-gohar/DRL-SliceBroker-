# DRL-SliceBroker

## Overview

This repository contains the code used in the experiments conducted for the paper titled ["An online cost minimization of the slice broker based on deep reinforcement learning"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2024.110198), which has been accepted for publication in [Computer Networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/computer-networks). The code provided here represents an experimental implementation that evolved from an initial exploration into deep reinforcement learning. 

## Disclaimer
